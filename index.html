Content There are 3 sections you must include within the website:
    About: A short introduction on who you are and what you bring to the table.
    Work: Some examples of work that you have done that you want to showcase. This could include past projects that you have worked on, current projects that you are currently doing, class projects, internships, and clubs!
    Contact: A section where potential site-visitors could find your social media handles, and an email or phone number to contact you.
HTML
    One use of each type of header <h1>-<h6>
    One use of <div> with flex layout. Hint: flex is useful for adding arbitrarily many containers into a space.
    One use of <div> with grid layout. Hint: grid is useful for aligning and laying out several similar containers.
    One use of <a>. This must be set to open in a new tab.
    One use of <img>
    One use of <button>. The button can do anything.
    One use of <title> and <author>. Hint: this should go in the <head>
    One functional component. This should be something quirky that shows off your knowledge. It should be a form input that triggers some JavaScript function. It does not have to do something that is necessarily useful, it only has to do something. This will be graded on the following component:
        Use of JavaScript from a <script> tag
        Use of a <form> component, with a <label> and <input> (can be of any input type).
        Use of a <submit> button.
CSS
    * selector
    .[class] selector
    #[id] selector
    :hover pseudoselector
    font property
Style Check The code you write must be readable and efficient (eg. sensible and self-documenting names, appropriate use of CSS classes, etc...)

    <!-- ABOUT -->
    <h2>Welcome to my digital portfolio!</h2>
    <h5>Hello there! I am Chen Wei, a final year Mechanical Engineering Undergraduate at the National University of Singapore.
        Enrolled in the Engineering Scholars Programme, I enjoy coding, computer-aided design as well as human-computer interaction.
        Over the years, I have had the opportunity to work on a number of incredible projects that have allowed me to grow and establish myself within this competitive industry.
        I hope that you will enjoy viewing my projects as much as I enjoyed working on them.
        Go ahead and explore, and do not hesitate to reach out if you would like to learn more!
